*promi* is, at least for now, a toy project to help myself getting familiar with the *Rust* programming language and
process mining. There's lots of tools and libraries for PM out there that, to put id mildly, don't make me happy. But
that's another story.

However, that doesn't mean the project won't get into a more professional shape at some point. Hence criticism,
suggestions and of course contributions are [welcome](https://github.com/PM4Rs/promi/issues)!

## Usage

Writing tutorials is time consuming and does not make much sense as stuff is changing rapidly. I suggest to jump right
into code, see [examples](https://github.com/PM4Rs/promi/tree/master/examples) section instead.
